# First Project
In order to create a new project in Rust, you can run:
```bash
cargo new project_name
```
And then it will create a folder called `project_name` with a `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml` files AND a `src` folder containing a `main.rs` file.

## Cargo.toml
It's similar to `package.json`.

## Compiling a project
```bash
cargo run
```
The executable file will be at `target/debug/project_name`.
